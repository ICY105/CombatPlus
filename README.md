# Alternitive Combat
A datapack adding some new weapons to spice up combat in Minecraft.

Currently Adds:
1. Sickles: linear cooldown only triggering on hit instead of on swing
2. Hammers: axe-like variant to sickles
3. Scythes: Damage Decay system- damage decrease slightly on hit and recharges over time
4. Maces: axe-like variant to Scythes
5. Katanas: Combo damage system- damage starts out low, but increases with each successive hit
6. Knives: Like weaker swords, but can be thrown with right click
7. Arc Stars: A stick grenade that explodes after a short delay, breaking blocks and slowing nearby entities
8. Spears: No cooldown
